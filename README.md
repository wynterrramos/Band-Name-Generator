# Band-Name-Generator
Day 1 of 100 Days of Code: A simple Python band name generator using input and string concatenation.

This is a simple Python script that asks the user for a city and a pet name to generate a band name. It was created as part of Day 1 of my 100 Days of Code: Python journey.

## What I Learned

* How to use `input()` to get user input  
* How to store data in variables  
* How to use string concatenation  
* Basic terminal interaction using `print()`

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository or download the file `band_name_generator.py`.
2. Make sure you have Python 3 installed.
3. Run the script:

```bash
python band_name_generator.py
